ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):
1. The probability of two heads and two tails are 25% while one head and one
   tail is 50%. The reason why one head and one tail is twice the probability 
   of the other cases is that this situation actually include two cases: (coin1
   head, coin2 tail) and (coin1 tail, coin2 head). Then the probability is 
   bigger than two heads or two tails case. 

2. Roughly 10^3 or more trails can ensure a stable result as the theory value.

3. Roughly 2*10^9 trails are applicable, but when it comes to 10^10 trials the
   program crashes with error.
