ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]

DESCRIPTION OF YOUR CLASS DESIGN AND ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES USED:


Three classes are created: GenText, Prefix, RandomTextGenerator
Prefix.java
This class represents the structure of prefix. It contains an arraylist
which is the prefix strings and a prefix length to indicate the order of
the Markov method. It overrides several methods in order to be as the
Key of HashMap.

RandomTextGenerator.java
This class is a generator, initiated by an input file and specific order of
the Markov method. Then we create a Markov Map to store the prefix and successor
information of file. Also it has a method to generate the next word based on
current prefix and the Markov Map. The Markov Map is a HashMap with Key of 
Prefix class and Value of ArrayList<String> class.

GenText.java
This class contains the main function. It obtains the input parameter and 
also has error-checking function toward the inputs. It reads input from 
file and generates several words and writes to an output file.
